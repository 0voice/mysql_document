In your role as a database designer, look for the most efficient way to organize your schemas, tables, and columns. As when tuning application code, you minimize I/O, keep related items together, and plan ahead so that performance stays high as the data volume increases. Starting with an efficient database design makes it easier for team members to write high-performing application code, and makes the database likely to endure as applications evolve and are rewritten.
