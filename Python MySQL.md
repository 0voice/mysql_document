Please note that all tutorials in this section are based on Python 3. If you’re looking to learn Python programming or refresh your Python knowledge quickly, you can check out the [Python tutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/).

## Section 1. Getting Started with MySQL Connector/Python

- [Getting Started with MySQL Python Connector](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/python-mysql/getting-started-mysql-python-connector/) – Help you get started with MySQL Connector/Python by introducing the features of the MySQL Python connector and guiding you through the installation process on your system.
- [Connecting to a MySQL Database in Python](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/python-mysql/python-connecting-mysql-databases/) – Show you how to use the connect() function and MySQLConnection object to establish a connection to a MySQL database.

## Section 2. Performing Basic Operations (CRUD)

This section shows you how to perform basic operations, including querying data, inserting data, updating data, and deleting data.

- [Querying Data from a Table in Python](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/python-mysql/python-mysql-query/) – Show you how to query data in a MySQL database in Python using Python/Connector API, including functions like `fetchone`, `fetchmany`, and `fetchall`.
- [Inserting Data Into a Table](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/python-mysql-insert/) – Learn how to insert data into a table using MySQL Connector/Python API.
- [Updating Data in a Table](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/python-mysql-update/) – Walk you through the steps required to update data in database tables using MySQL Connector/Python API.
- [Deleting Data from a Table](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/python-mysql/python-mysql-delete-data/) – Guide you on how to delete data in MySQL database using Python.

## Section 3. Stored Procedures

This section shows how to effectively work with MySQL store procedures in Python
