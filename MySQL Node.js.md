# MySQL Node.js

Node.js offers several packages to interact with MySQL databases. One of the most popular packages is [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql).

The `mysql` package facilitates the execution of SQL queries, allowing you access to MySQL seamlessly.

Whether you are developing API, server-side applications, or web applications, the mysql package simplifies database interactions using Node.js.

In this tutorial series, you will learn how to master the `mysql` package from scratch. You will learn how to perform common operations including:

- Connecting MySQL Server
- Creating a new table
- Inserting data into a table
- Querying data from a table
- Updating data
- Deleting data
- Calling a stored procedure

After the tutorial, you will be able to develop the Node.js application using MySQL as the back-end database.
