# MySQL Control Flow Functions and Expressions

The control flow functions allow you to add if-then-else logic to SQL queries without using the procedural code. The following show the most commonly used MySQL control flows functions:

- [CASE](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-control-flow-functions/mysql-case-function/) – return the corresponding result in `THEN` branch if the condition in the `WHEN` branch is satisfied, otherwise, return the result in the `ELSE` branch.
- [IF](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-control-flow-functions/mysql-if-function/) – return a value based on a given condition.
- [IFNULL](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-control-flow-functions/mysql-ifnull/)– return the first argument if it is not `NULL` , otherwise returns the second argument.
- [NULLIF](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-control-flow-functions/mysql-nullif/)– return `NULL` if the first argument is equal to the second argument, otherwise, returns the first argument.
